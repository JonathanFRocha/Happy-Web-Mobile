Install the modules for each folder before you start using the Happy APP.

Start the API with npm run dev, it is using Sqlite with ORM. 

then you can use npm start inside happyMobile or happyWeb or both, then you are set to go! :)

beware the mobile app, you'll need to change the ip to your Local ip to get access to the API.
